A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.A  medical  institution is  primarily devoted  to  the diagnosis and care  of patients.  According  to [2],  the appropriate  and timely provision  of complete and up-to-date patient data  to clinicians/hospitals  has  for  decades  been  one  of  the  most demanding  objectives  to  be  fulfilled  by  information technology in the healthcare domain. The degree to which the patients  are satisfied  with the  care received is relevant not only  to  the  doctors’  expertise  in  their  field  but also  to  the quality  of  services  offered  by  the  Hospital  Management System to  ease the  processes  the patient  goes through [1]. Nowadays  in  developing  countries,  patients  do  spend  a substantial amount of time in clinics/hospitals they registered for when waiting for services to be delivered by the doctors or health professionals. The cause is that most health centers and hospitals are presently using the personal computers and  manual  system  in  their  data  processing  and management which results to a number of problems: lack of standardized  data  collection,  difficulties  in  getting  correct data  from  legible  manual  records,  difficulties  in  storage, update  of  records  or  keeping  patients  historical  data  – diagnostic, drug prescription and billings; information can be lost when records are stolen, misplaced/ vandalized, patients are  made  to  contend  with  time  wastage  involved  in  the hospital  management  protocols.----- <img class="float-end p-2 ml-1 img-thumbnail" src="http://static.facegfx.com/2012/hd-medicine-picture-download_698261782.jpg" width="350px" height="400px">Manual  and  semi-manual methods  are simple and  easy to  implement,  but cannot  be efficiently  used  to  manage  large  amount  of  patient information or handle urgent critical cases easily At present, more patients suffer from multiple chronic diseases. However, the hospital's existing chronic disease management is carried out according to the department. This means that a patient needs to go to more than one department for a chronic disease treatment. Therefore, this study proposes 6 dimensions (organizational management, medical service support, medical service, community alliance, self-management support, management information system) and 36 questions, to help evaluate the current chronic disease management system in China's large third-class hospitals. In this study, 143 survey samples from doctors and nurses were collected. A principal component analysis was used to extract three key elements of chronic disease management service delivery system (service management organization, management information system, medical core service). Then, multiple regression was used to establish the relationship model between the overall performance of the system and the main elements. Three key service nodes of the system (medical specialist support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention) were determined according to the weight of the regression model. The regression coefficients of the above three main elements show a similar impact on the overall performance of the system, but the key service nodes under each major element have relative differences, including medical specialist support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention. Finally, to establish a chronic disease management system with multiple departmental continuous care for chronic diseases, it is necessary to improve the chronic disease management system from three aspects of medical specialty support, patient tracking management and personalized intervention. This paper proposes corresponding improvement strategies.-----Ji Hong is a doctor who decided to become a high school teacher. He meets Hye Jung, a reckless student who happens to be his favorite neighbor's granddaughter and turns out to be his student. Their deep relationship led them to be accused of being in a romantic student-teacher relationship. 13 years later, they suddenly bump into each other under neurosurgery in the same hospital. Hye Jung is determined to avenge her grandmother's death due to medical malpractice, as Ji Hong is out to protect his highschool sweetheart. In between, they face numerous challenges in the operating room, within their relationship, and the political disputes within the hospital and its investors<img class="float-start p-2 ml-1 img-thumbnail" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/doctor-holding-digital-tablet-at-meeting-room-picture-id1189304032?b=1&k=20&m=1189304032&s=612x612&w=0&h=3IlZQ_IDMJDkjPCThsflr8vmCZVPmxXPWLzsxb8rShQ=" width="350px" height="400px">Post pandemic it is clear that telemedicine adoption is expected to grow rapidly. Patients love the convenience and the fact that it gives them more control over their time and helps them control costs. For providers, the right telemedicine platform can help increase revenues, improve efficiency and improve patient satisfaction. A combination of user-friendly telemedicine software solutions, availability of high speed data networks and the availability of health devices, mean that telemedicine is set to play a transformative role in redefining healthcare delivery in the coming decade. Telemedicine software applications have also opened the door for the development of new models of healthcare and now the healthcare industry stands to benefit from innovation that has been unleashed.Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services over a distance using telecommunication technology. From its humble beginnings in the 1950’s telemedicine has evolved rapidly to a point where providers can now effectively treat patients online for a wide range of health conditions and scenarios. A telemedicine platform is a software solution that brings together all the necessary technology which allows healthcare providers to remotely evaluate, diagnose and treat patients. A telemedicine platform is a software solution that brings together all the necessary technology which allows healthcare providers to remotely evaluate, diagnose and treat patients. Note that white telehealth is actually broader in scope compared to telemedicine, both telehealth and telemedicine are typically used interchangeably. Hence telehealth software or telehealth platform typically refer to a telemedicine software platform. While interactive video consultations are currently the most common form of telemedicine, telemedicine technology platforms are typically broader in scope. They typically cover all aspects of patient online consultations and also act as the digital front-door for your healthcare organisation.
